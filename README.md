# PiVR-Fusion-and-STL-files
Bucknell PiVR supplemental files

The files contained here are the modified versions of Tadres and Louis' PiVR camera mount for Bucknell University. 

The Fusion 360 files (.f3d) can be loaded in Fusion360 (free through Bucknell) or any other AutoCAD software. This allows the user to make any modifications they so desire to meet their ends. If one does so, they must export such files as an STL (see below) for the models to be used by a 3D printer. 

The STL (.stl) files are files designed for a 3D printer. They cannot be modified within an AutoCAD program but are designed to be used with any form of 3D printing software (such as Simplify3D). In order to save a file as an STL, go to File -> Export and select STL from the Extension options.
